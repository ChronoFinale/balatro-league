// Export every REAL league player (name + Discord ID) to league-players.csv.
// This is the reference Team Tour uses to auto-fill Discord IDs for imported
// players (most TT players also play the league, so this resolves the bulk
// without hand-mapping). Run it against the live league DB, then drop the CSV
// into apps/tour/ and run the TT export.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/export-league-players.mjs
//
// Reads DATABASE_URL from .env. Skips seeded/fake players (non-snowflake ids).
